  author    = "Andrews, George E",
  abstract  = "This book develops the theory of partitions. Simply put, the
               partitions of a number are the ways of writing that number as
               sums of positive integers. For example, the five partitions of 4
               are 4, 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1, and 1+1+1+1. Surprisingly, such a simple
               matter requires some deep mathematics for its study. This book
               considers the many theoretical aspects of this subject, which
               have in turn recently found applications to statistical
               mechanics, computer science and other branches of mathematics.
               With minimal prerequisites, this book is suitable for students
               as well as researchers in combinatorics, analysis, and number
               theory.",

               numerous applications, and celebrated results such as the

               romance of mathematics.The aim in this introductory textbook is
               to provide an accessible and wide ranging introduction to
               partitions, without requiring anything more of the reader than
               some familiarity with polynomials and infinite series. Many
